1
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:10,162
La Violetera

2
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,835
Carnations, camellias, violets!

3
00:02:27,636 --> 00:02:31,140
Flowers, sir?
- No, thank you.

4
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:37,949
The program is good, sir.
Cheer up, take one.

5
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,054
Violets, sir.
- I would love violets!

6
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:48,162
Thank you, sir. Violets?
They are the flowers of joy!

7
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:52,767
They only cost one real.
Thank you, sir.

8
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:59,376
Soledad! Five fresh ones.
- Violets, sir.

9
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:03,781
Don't say "no"! Ladies like these
deserve flowers like these!

10
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:08,287
She sells, and we, nothing!
What does she have that I don't?

11
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:12,692
Violets and she's only 20.

12
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:15,796
What are you doing here, Lola?
- Shopping.

13
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,901
Where are you spending Christmas?
- Nowhere. - Come to my place.

14
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:25,108
I'm not sure if I'll make it.
Look how much I have left!

15
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:32,117
Happy holidays, then!
- Thank you and Happy New Year!

16
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:35,101
Violets! Violets!

17
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:42,731
Violets? For your girl, handsome.
- Thank you.

18
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:50,720
You're welcome.
- Hey, you! We decided you should leave.

19
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,192
Who are "we"?
- All of us.

20
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:59,165
Let me tell you, I'm not going.
